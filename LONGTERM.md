# Long term developments

This document outlines developments lying outside of the initial planned ARRP 2016 release feature set.

## Village

Here is one of the first views of a village. You can see area-specific generated NPCs, as well as a Markov-generated village name.

Here is a slightly later view showing a procedurally generated river and bridge, grass-coloured backdrop, and another name.

Subsequent view showing full-visibility daytime above-ground field of view, a procedurally generated river and bridge, grass-coloured backdrop, various suitable village animals, and another name.

Still later view showing the above plus ugly houses and trees. Not so different to currently.

## World generation

This is a separate program I am working on worldgen in. The idea is to procedurally generate a wilderness with general topography, distance and features matching that of ancient Yunnan. This will be used to ensure that every game is different but also similar in a general way, which hopefully should be enough to hang procedural plot features off. Certainly, given the richness of the region's history, this should work. It's low priority right now, however, and the intent right now is to get something out for ARRP2016 which means I am very short on time. Therefore we have a simplified localized worldgen as a placeholder right now.

In the graphic below, the upper river is the Jinshajiang (upper Yangtse), the lower river is the Red River, and the central lake is Erhai.
