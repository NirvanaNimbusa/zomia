# zomia

Roguelike game set in ancient Yunnan: a wild land where the longest and most powerful rivers of Asia emerge from Tibet to flow down through tropics to the world's great oceans. Hemmed in by steep and ancient mountain topography, malarial jungles and hostile neighbouring civilizations, it is a region shattered in to many distinct ethnic and religious groups, each with their own culture and language. Who will unite the peoples of Zomia and bring peace to the land?

## Project background

I twisted my ankle in Vietnam in early August 2016 and decided to use part of the resulting enforced period of immobility to learn me some Lua! A roguelike based on Yunnanese history seemed the obvious project. I don't expect to spend much time on it beyond the current few weeks, so plan to launch an early version of it for the [2016 Annual Roguelike Release Party](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=2016_ARRP). This gives me approximately nine days to get something playable together. Not a great deal of time... anyway, you can also check out [Zomia's entry on Roguebasin](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Zomia).

## Development status

Development began on the 2nd of September, 2016. As of September 8 it is possible to walk around a level, sound and graphics are functional and some back-story is on the way to being generated. There are NPCs you can run in to, they make noises but there is no fighting or interaction yet, and they don't move. There is an awful lot of free audio media prepared as well... almost 1GB so far.

Screenshots will be here shortly.
